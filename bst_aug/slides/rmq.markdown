RMQ (range minimum query)
---

Given array ```a[1..n]``` of $n$ objects of well-ordered set
for given $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$ find the minimal element
in subarray ```a[l..r]```

. . .

Old method won't work?

. . .

Actually much-much larger class of similar problems is solvable with generic approach! (stay tuned)
