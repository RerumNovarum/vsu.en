Lazy propagation
----------------

Let's consider another type of queries:

Given $k_1, k_2 \in K, v\in V$
associate all the keys $k: k_1 \leq k \leq k_2$
with value $v$

Lazy propagation
----------------

We can modify existing solution
to store in node `cache`
along with value
and propagate it lazily
to childrens as you go down
