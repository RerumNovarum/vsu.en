Threats and threat models
=========================

WHY?
----

It's always about money and influence

And sometimes just about hostility


Privacy. Opensource information
-------------------------------

> Privacy is completely and utterly dead, and we killed it
(c) Steven Rambam

All the personal info is now opensource

* Name, bd, home address
* Political views, sexual orientation
* Photos, geotags

These are contributed by people themselves

This information makes you and your neighbourhood
vulnerable to social engineering attacks

Also, hope you're not used to specify your real city or birthdate
as an answer to these "secure questions", like some people in Voronezh like to do?

Privacy. Recording
------------------

> Privacy is completely and utterly dead, and we killed it
(c) Steven Rambam

Every single movement of a person is recorded in some database

* Medical records
* Criminal records
* Border crossings
* Employment history
* Bank records
* 24/7 tracking via goddamn mobile phone

And ALL of these are cross-linked

* * *

Privacy. Recording
------------------

All these things you or somebody has contributed into public domain
will NEVER EVER be deleted

Think of it before you post in the blog

Proliferated malicious services, soft and hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Malicious soft and hardware nowadays is extremely widespread.
It is often proprietary products,
enforced by governments and multiple monopolies.
People are usually chained in 

Closed standards (forcing ppl to use malicious software from e.g. Microsoft)

* * *

Proliferated malicious services, soft and hardware
--------------------------------------------------

* Document circulation (e.g. proprietary MS .doc)
* Correspondence
    * Proprietary mail/chat services
      with surveillance enabled by-default
    * Even worser, services,
      that require to execute malicious code on your machine,
      with backdoors included,
      e.g. Skype
* Mobile telephony, all these CDMA, &c
    * Almost no encryption, vulnerable to everyone who got hardware
    * Just a blackbox living it's own life
        * You cannot disable this module even by unplugging battery
        * Probably these modules have access to host
    * 24/7 tracking, while you're walking among cells

* * *

Proliferated malicious services, soft and hardware
--------------------------------------------------

NSA has been recording all the text messages passing through cellphone networks,
and recording arbitrary citizens w/o judgement

Also they've deployed massive sigint system

* * *

Proliferated malicious services, soft and hardware

![Upgrade from Windows][upgradefromwindows]


* * *

Proliferated malicious services, soft and hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware backdoors

* Intel ME
    * Full access to RAM
    * Screen monitoring
    * Access to peripherals
    * Can NOT be disabled (except for extremely old chips)
* Reported backdoors in WD hard drives' firmwares
* Mobile phones.
  Just a goddamn uncontrollable blackbox which spies on you
* Secure boot and other digital restriction means
    * Supposed to be a security feature,
      but used instead to restrict user's freedom

Proliferated malicious services, soft and hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Proprietary services

* Put you in a jail of legal traps
* In 2009 Amazon massively ERASED
  copies of Orwell's 1984 from ebooks of it's users
* Apple uploads to the cloud and deletes local copies of audio files
  w/o user's permission.
  And you'll never get exact copies back, only lossy versions
* Microsoft got [killswitch][windows8killswitch] to delete arbitrary program from your machine
* All of these -- compliant with their EULA.
  In particular, Apple is not responsible for any bogus behaviour of it's service

* * *

Proliferated malicious services, soft and hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Proprietary operating systems

* Have throughout control over user's computer
    * Automatic installation or "upgrading" w/o user intervention
* Full access to file system
    * Didn't you disable Skydirve?
    * Your whole "Documents" folder has been legally uploaded to MS servers
* Remote code execution
* Installations log, keylogging, whatever
* Licensing traps
    * MS (Apple, Amazon, all of them, you can read)
      can LEGALLY delete any of your files or programs

All of these are [MALWARE][apple_malware]

Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)
-------------------------------------

* Technical means to restrict user's freedom to use it's media (and not only media)
* Based on legal enforcement of manufacturers (and users)
  to include malicious code blobs to the software
* Based on infamous "Security through obscurity" approach
* Main ideas:
    * Money of out the air, never let the user own content, instead license temporarily to stream

Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)
-------------------------------------

> It's certainly easier to implement bad security
> and make it illegal for anyone to notice

(c) Bruce Schneier


* * *

Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)
-------------------------------------

DRM (also patents, partially copytight, &c) actually reduces to the following:

Corporation is trying to establish a monopoly
and to restrict people to use only it's service
and only in the way Corp. wants to.
Via lobbyists Corp. makes government to support and protect
Corp.'s intention to threat people

In the result, to protect an ill-meaning minority, gov-t forces entire Majority
to install and use proprietary and closed malicious hard and software,
that potentially (i.e. almost always) contains backdoors &c

Such a nonsense

* * *

Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)
-------------------------------------

Nowadays multiple Evil-corps, including e.g. Microsoft, Netflix, others
are trying hard to make DRM part of HTML5 standard

Vulnerable services
-------------------

Whoever you are i'm sure there is in your chat logs
some evidence of criminal offence you've had commited,
some "pirate" content,
or some private photos

Most of the services you use aren't secured

Vast majority of them tightly cooperate with special services

And almost all of them collect statistics and sell info about you
to whoever gonna pay

* * *

Vulnerable services
-------------------

And most of them weren't developed with security in mind

Most of the android applications ignore certificate checking,
which makes them vulnerable to MiTM attacks

Fundamental technologies themselves like SSL are defective,
they're based on centralised CA's,
which makes special services able to perform MiTM transparently

* * *

Vulnerable services
-------------------

BTW, these "special services" cannot cope with community via technical means.
So governments are trying to restrict community legally

For example 5Eyes countries are up to legally forbid end-to-end encryption

And in Russia e.g. Hardware Security modules were prohibited a while ago

Also Russian gov-t prohibited any open wireless stations,
which also means more secured and robust networking solutions like meshnetworking
are prohibited

* * *

Vulnerable services
-------------------

Services advertised as security concerned can be vulnerable

E.g. widely-advertised Telegram messenger is flawe by-default
since it depends on mobile network operator and gives access to your account
to anyone in the company who can e.g produce new sim card

Also it is technically possible to intercept the SMS

* * *

Vulnerable services
-------------------

All the widespread desktop operating system have totally broken security system

E.g. 

* the concept of "superuser", i.e. elevating program's rights to do whatever it wants
* lack of isolation
* &c

* * *

Poisoned in foundation
----------------------

Most of contemporary communications and computing systems
are extremely vulnerable and fragile

Mainly because of centralisation

* * *

Poisoned in foundation. IP
--------------------------

1. Global routing table is so huge for a single router
2. Centralisation; a few registered organisation control entire internet
    1. Political influence:
       governments are already using centralisation to build up an iron maiden

       E.g. when egyptians risen up, egyptian government just had the Internet shut down,
       to prevent events coverage 
    2. Fragility: you only need to destroy a few objectives to start an apocalypse

* * *

Poisoned in foundation. DNS
---------------------------

(for technical limitations) there are only 13 DNS clusters serving ENTIRE internet

Again vulnerable to both political repressions and all the kinds of denial of service attacks

* * *

Poisoned in foundation. SSL
---------------------------

Uses multiple Central Authorities for verification

These are ruled by corporations and governments,
you by definition cannot trust them

Protection
==========

Free software
-------------

First of all, REJECT all the software and hardware
that restricts your freedom

In eighties RMS started GNU movement,
for developing GNU system,
which would respect four main user' freedoms

0. Freedom to run program as you wish
1. Freedom to study program and to change it so it does what you wish
2. Freedom to redistribute exact copies
3. Freedom to distribute modified versions

* * *

Free software
-------------

It is mandatory to use only free software,
with publicly audited source code

For end-user closed-source program and any service that uses "security-through-obscurity"
is insecure by-definition

* * *

Secure communications
---------------------

Bulk surveillance can be outweighted if the Majority
of people will start to use end-to-end encryption

It will reduce amount of info collected about us
and also throughout usage of E2EE will make it impossible
to distinguish between private data and regular things

* GPG for email
* OTR and OMEMO for instant messaging
* ZRTP for VoIP
* TOX for instant messaging and audio/video conferences

* * *

**Delete** your facebook, instagram, vkontakte profiles

Use [mediagoblin](https://mediagoblin.org/) instead of youtube,
[pump.io](https://pump.io/) instead of twitter

* * *

Secure communications
---------------------

![Email selfdefence guide by EFF][emailselfdefence]

Web of trust
------------

One of the main concepts of computer security
is the one of Web of Trust

Istead of using central authorities,
the people themselves use their own keys to sign others' keys,
i.e. acknowledge the binding between authenticity and the public key

This system is decentralised and if used correctly,
there is always exact persons responsible

* * *

OTR
---

Off-the-record messaging

Easily established, public-key based

Provides:

* E2E encryption
* Authentication
* Deniability
* Perfect forward secrecy

* * *

OMEMO
-----

Multi-end to multi-end message and object encryption

* Future and forward secrecy
* Message synchronization
* Offline delivery
* Multi-end encryption
* Multiple devices
* File transfer
* Verifiability
* Deniability
* Easy to setup and use

* * *

Anonymious browsing
-------------------

There are solutions to communicate and browse the internet anonymiously

* The Onion Routing

  Idea is to use network, in which you can "plan" the route of the packet you send
  and to wrap messages via several levels of encryption
  
  Every node carrying your message will only know adjacent nodes,
  but it will never know source and destination

  The simplest usage is to use Tor Browser Bundle

* Invisible Internet Project (I2P)

  Another overlay network, in which every message is sent pseudonymously and securely

  Comprises E2E encryption for everything by-default

  Allows for anonymious bittorrent, irc, email, &c

  Multiple useful web services,
  e.g. an0nymious markets like Silk Road
  (discredited by govt ostensibly for occasional usage by drug-dillers)

  * * *

  Bitcoin, the only secure currency
  ---------------------------------

  Based on cryptography,
  instead of lies of politicians and bankers

  Maintains publicly Huge database of all the transactions

* * *

Go harder: safe environment. Tails and friends
----------------------------------------------

There are special distributions designed
to setup one-time identity

You boot from live-usb,
connect to the net (e.g. tor)
and there is no metadata this system may accidentaly leak

* * *

Go harder: safe environment. Whonix
----------------------------------------------

And still there is possibility,
that some application will ocassionally
connect without proxy
to the host you supposed to connect to anonymiously,
thus revealing your real IP addres

One of the solutions is Whonix

* * *

Go harder: safe environment. Whonix
----------------------------------------------

The idea is simple:

* Run a separate virtual machine to establish tor connection (Gateway)
* Run a separate machine for browsing with the only network interface
  which is a bridge to Gateway that redirects EVERYTHING into tor

Security-by-isolation... That works

* * *

Secure environment. SE Linux
----------------------------

Security-enhanced linux

Introduces mandatory access control,
roles, contexts, &c
instead of unix' stupid discretionary control (rwx)

Multiple benefits

E.g.

* When a program needs to read a specific (protected) file,
  you don't elevate it'a privileges to the root level,
  you allow to read a specific file
* &c

Same concept, everything is prohibited,
until user explicitly permits specific action

* * *

Secure environment. Android 6.0
----------------------------

Android dev-team made a big deal
to adopt SE Linux for Android

Since 6.0 every single domain #TODO

* * *

Secure environment
------------------

Security cannot be an extension,
a system should be designed with security in mind

Qubes OS is based on concept of security-by-isolation

It runs every separate task in isolated domain,
i.e. in virtual machines

* * *

Prepare to detention
--------------------

Use full-disk encryption via LUKS

It is quite easy to follow e.g. archlinux' guide
Also LUKS recently introduced nuke-passphrase feature,
which once entered makes kernel module to literally
Nuke entire cryptcontainer,
which means it's almost impossible
to force user to give up private data during ingerrogation
(but probably bloody KGB has the means)
